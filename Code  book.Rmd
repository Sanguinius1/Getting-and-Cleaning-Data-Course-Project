This is the codebook accompanying and explaining the variables of the Tidydata.txt. This data was generated using the script run_analysis.R. 

Note: for better understanding the  variable names have been altered to be more readable. First, special characters  such as () and - have been removed.  Abbreviations are fully spelled  out, e.g: "Acc" -> "Accelerometer", "t" -> "time", etc. A typo "BodyBody" has been fixed to "Body".

The source of the data set is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

Information on the data set itself, quoted from source "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones":
"Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."


Steps that led  to the creation of Tidydata.txt:

    1. The training and the test sets were merged to create one data set.
    2. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.
    3. Descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set are used.
    4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, a second, independent tidy data set (Tidydata.txt) was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
VARIABLES: 

1. Subjects
integer; People taking part in the tests. Range from 1 to 30.


2. Activities
character; Identifier denouncing what tasks the subjects performed during the tests:
```{r}
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING
```
 
MEASUREMENTS and UNITS:

Measurements captured are body acceleration and angular velocity Note: Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Units before normalization: standard gravity units (9.81 m/sÂ²) for measurement of body 
```{r}
Acceleration
```
values
and
radians/second (rd.s^-1) for measurement of angular velocity captured in
```{r}
Gyroscope
```
values.

Also, the
```{r}
magnitude
```
of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The data set is parted in two domains, all signals are floating point numbers:

timeDomain values are results of the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals.

frequencyDomain signals are the results of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) being applied to some of the signals.
